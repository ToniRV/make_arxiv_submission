# make_arxiv_submission
Generates a ready to submit arxiv zip file out of your paper.

just call `bash generate_arxiv_zip.bash` at the root of your paper latex files.

## ToDos:

Currently assumes:
- arxiv folder is already created
- IEEE cls files
- Expects main.tex main.bbl (so the thing must be compiled and not weirdly named)
